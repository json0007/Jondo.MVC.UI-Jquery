# Jondo.MVC.UI-Jquery
UI library for .net mvc and with jquery

This is meant to mimic Kendo.UI for MVC with Jquery. Kendo is too expensive and buggy imo. There support sucks and nothing get's fixed. Collegues used to joke I should write my own, hence Jondo was born.  

This is meant to be an open source project. Feel free to use it as you wish.
